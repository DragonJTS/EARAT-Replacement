Example pages:
login.php - just a basic form. Has an example of how to print login error messages 
(stored in session), without getting an error if the session doesn't exist

logged_in.php - A basic page showing how to use a required statement to check
that the user is logged in, and printing data from the session.

CRITICAL CODE:
check_login.php - submit for data (via post, obviously) to this in order for it to be
compared against the db. Will either redirect to login page (and store an error message
in a session), or redirect to a "logged in" page (and store that the user is logged in,
as well as their name, in a session)
TO BE CHANGED: Obviously, the database names and info will need to be changed, and we'll
probably want to store different info in the session (like first/last name, trade), so
we can display it without searching the database, plus their primary key, for when
we do need to access the database again.

session_check.php - confirms the user is logged in, redirect them to login, with error,
if they aren't. As shown in logged_in, is added to a page with a simple required command.
MUST BE REQUIRED, include will let the page run if the file can't be found (bad), required
stop the page (good). Put in header to prevent loading content before confirming status.

session_destroy.php - simply destroys the session, and redirects user to login page.
Log out buttons should redirect to this.
